The gem is\ndestroyed when the spell is cast and disappears\nfrom the helm.\n* As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm\nemits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least\none undead is within that area. Any undead that\nstarts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant\ndamage.\n* As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have\nresistance to fire damage.\n* As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you\ncan use an action and speak a command word to\ncause one weapon you are holding to burst into\nflames.

On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams\nof light from its remaining gems. Each creature\nwithin 60 feet of the helm other than you must\nsucceed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be\nstruck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the\nnumber of gems in the helm.

It unfolds into a\ncircular sheet 6 feet in diameter.\nYou can use an action to unfold a portable hole and\nplace it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the\nportable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10\nfeet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole\nexists on a different plane, so it can't be used to\ncreate open passages. Any creature inside an open\nportable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.\nYou can use an action to close a portable hole by\ntaking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up.\nFolding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures\nor objects within remain in the extradimensional\nspace. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to\nnothing.\nIf the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's\nextradimensional space can use an action to make a\nDC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the\ncreature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet\nof the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A\nbreathing creature within a closed portable hole can\nsurvive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it\nbegins to suffocate.\nPlacing a portable hole inside an extradimensional\nspace created by a bag of holding, handy haversack,\nor similar item instantly destroys both items and\nopens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates\nwhere the one item was placed inside the other. Any\ncreature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through\nit and deposited in a random location on the Astral\nPlane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only\nand can't be reopened.\n",

While holding the staff, you can use an\naction to expend some of its charges to cast one of\nthe following spells from it, using your spell save DC\nand spellcasting ability: conjure elemental (7\ncharges), dispel magic (3 charges), fireball (7th-level\nversion, 7 charges), flaming sphere (2 charges), ice\nstorm (4 charges), invisibility (2 charges), knock (2\ncharges), lightning bolt (7th-level version, 7 charges),\npasswall (5 charges), plane shift (7 charges),\ntelekinesis (5 charges), wall of fire (4 charges), or\nweb (2 charges).\nYou can also use an action to cast one of the\nfollowing spells from the staff without using any\ncharges: arcane lock, detect magic, enlarge/reduce,\nlight, mage hand, or protection from evil and good.\nRetributive Strike. You can use an action to break\nthe staff over your knee or against a solid surface,\nperforming a retributive strike. The staff is\ndestroyed and releases its remaining magic in an\nexplosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere\ncentered on it.\nYou have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to\na random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion.\nIf you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage\nequal to 16 x the number of charges in the staff.\nEvery other creature in the area must make a DC 17\nDexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature\ntakes an amount of damage based on how far away it\nis from the point of origin, as shown in the following\ntable. On a successful save, a creature takes half as\nmuch damage.\nDistance from Origin Damage\n10 ft. away or closer 8 x the number of charges in the staff\n11 to 20 ft. away 6 x the number of charges in the staff\n21 to 30 ft. away 4 x the number of charges in the staff\nStaff of the Python\nStaff, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric,\ndruid, or warlock)\nYou can use an action to speak this staff's command\nword and throw the staff on the ground within 10\nfeet of you. The staff becomes a giant constrictor\nsnake under your control and acts on its own\ninitiative count. By using a bonus action to speak the\ncommand word again, you return the staff to its\nnormal form in a space formerly occupied by the\nsnake.\nOn your turn, you can mentally command the\nsnake if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren't\nincapacitated. You decide what action the snake\ntakes and where it moves during its next turn, or you\ncan issue it a general command, such as to attack\nyour enemies or guard a location.\nIf the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and\nreverts to its staff form. The staff then shatters and is\ndestroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before\nlosing all its hit points, it regains all of them.\n",
